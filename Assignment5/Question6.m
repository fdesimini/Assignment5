//Define a class called XYPoint that will hold a Cartesian coordinate (x, y), where x and y are integers. Define methods to individually set the x and y coordinates of a point and retrieve their values. Write an Objective-C program to implement your new class and test it.

/*

class name = XYPoint

int valueOfX
int valueOfY

method names:
setX
setY

*/



//create an instance of the XYPoint class and initialize it

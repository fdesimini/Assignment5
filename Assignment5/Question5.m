//In a procedural language such as C, you think about actions and then write code to perform the action on various objects. Referring to the car example, you might write a procedure in C to wash a vehicle and then inside that procedure write code to handle washing a car, washing a boat, washing a motorcycle, and so on. If you took that approach and then wanted to add a new vehicle type (see the previous exercise), do you see advantages or disadvantages to using this procedural approach over an object- oriented approach?

/*

The disadvantage to using a procedural language such as C in the above example is that you would have to write a new procedure for the new vehicle type, whereas in Obj-C you would just use a method that was already created for the same procedure.
